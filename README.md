# EXPO
# EXPO - C++ Interpreter Project

EXPO is a C++ interpreter designed to evaluate and execute C++ expressions. This project provides a basic framework for interpreting C++ syntax, parsing tokens, and evaluating expressions using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This project aims to understand and implement an interpreter that can parse and execute simple C++ expressions.

## Features
- Tokenizes C++ expressions.
- Parses the tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- Supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Provides error handling for unexpected tokens and invalid syntax.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang).
- C++17 support or higher is recommended.
- `Make` (if you wish to compile using a Makefile).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shantanu-777/EXPO.git
   cd EXPO
   ```

2. Compile the project:
   - If you are using GCC:
     ```bash
     g++ -std=c++17 -o expo main.cpp parser.cpp token.cpp
     ```

3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./expo
   ```

### Running the Interpreter
Once you have compiled and built the interpreter, you can use it to interpret basic arithmetic expressions. For example, you can run:

```bash
./expo "3 + 5 * (2 - 8)"
```

This should output the result of the evaluated expression.

## Code Structure

- **`main.cpp`**: The entry point of the program. It initializes the interpreter and starts the parsing process.
- **`parser.cpp`**: Contains the logic for parsing tokens and building an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- **`token.cpp`**: Defines the token types and the process of tokenizing input.
- **`ASTNode` and derived classes**: Represent different types of nodes in the Abstract Syntax Tree.

## Contributing

### Notes:
- **Repository Purpose**: I added a description because it's an interpreter project. If thereâ€™s something more specific you'd like to highlight about the project, you can update the "Features" and "Running the Interpreter" sections.
- **Installation Instructions**: These assume a simple setup with a C++ compiler. If you use a specific build system (like `Make` or `CMake`), update that section.
- **Code Structure**: I outlined a basic project structure. Could you modify it if the file structure is different in your case?
